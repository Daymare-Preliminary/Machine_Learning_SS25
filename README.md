These is my personal summary, to study for the exam Machine Learning held by Prof. Dr. Aleksandar Bojchevski 
in the summer semester 2025 at the University of Cologne.
This is neither a script nor are these lecture notes, but rather a personal synopsis summarizing 
the main concepts and ideas from the lecture.
A compiled version can be found [here](ML_notes.pdf).
